# Estimating Clausing factor in 2D

## The concept and the background

Clausing factor, a factor defined in molecular flow regime, is the protion of gas molecules reaching the other side of a tube among those entering the tube. By definition, molecular flow regime is where the mean free path (the distance a molecule travels before colliding with other moleules) is much longer than the container size, and each molecule is therefore idependent from other molecules and will collide with container walls many times before meeting each other; in other words, molecules do not "push" each other within the container.[^1] This means for a very small space (< 10 nm, a typical length scale for advance chips), the molecular behavior is alway in the molecular flow regime. Thus, during chemical vapor deposition in modern semiconductor fabrication, the Clausing factor is a useful concept to understand the mass transport of gas molecules in microscopic features dug out on wafer surfaces, such as troughs or holes with depth about 10 nm and opening about 2 nm.
